# Agentic Repo Protocol (Agent Orchestrator + Skills)

This project defines a framework workflow that provides an alternative to explicit multi-agent execution, in which task-specific agents are replaced with agent skills. Common to both single- and multi-agent environments, development begins by decomposing the project into high-level, well-defined development phases aligned with the project's structural or functional components. Each phase may encompass a focused task or be further decomposed into a group of related tasks.

In a multi-agent environment, each task is handled by a dedicated task agent that consumes specific inputs and produces outputs that may be used by other agents. The workflow is initiated by a managing agent, and task agents may hand off their outputs to one another according to the defined process. Within workflows modeled using a strict star (hub-and-spoke) topology, direct interaction between individual tasks is not allowed. This topology aligns well with modular, weakly coupled architectures and facilitates controlled development. At the center is a main prompt (or a sequence of prompts) passed to a coding agent solely responsible for orchestration and dispatching of individual tasks. The prompt instructing the orchestrator or manager agent must not include instructions unrelated to its managing role.

In a single-agent environment, individual tasks are no longer framed as specialized agents. Instead, each task is framed as an agent skill. The agent acting in the orchestrator role follows the workflow definition, which references skills rather than delegating work to separate task agents. The workflow explicitly defines the input and output of each task. Any information that must be passed between tasks is persisted as file artifacts within the project directory. Inputs expected by individual skills must be loaded either from predefined files in the project directory or via a predefined discovery logic operating on that directory. While skills may conceptually refer to other, more general skills, direct inter-skill coupling should be minimized.

A skill-based single-agent approach may still involve multiple agents and hybrid execution. While individual components or tasks may be executed by different agents, each agent operates within a single-agent execution model. When more than one agent is used, this approach does not rely on inter-agent interaction: execution control may be dispatched manually or via a deterministic script, which invokes AI calls using conventional (non-MCP) APIs.

The workflow is required to remain project-agnostic. All project-specific information is provided in `PROJECT.md`, which is read by the orchestrator at the beginning of execution. Swapping `PROJECT.md` should be sufficient to implement a different project consistent with the defined workflow. For example, if the workflow targets development of a simple single-page HTML game, it should be possible to develop different single-page HTML games, or even non-gaming projects implemented as single-page artifacts, without modifying the orchestration or skills infrastructure. Because execution occurs within a single agent, all loaded bootstrapping information should be available and accessible throughout the entire workflow within the agent's context.
